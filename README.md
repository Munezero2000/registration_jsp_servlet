### What is Logging?

Logging is the process of recording events or messages generated by a software application for debugging, monitoring, and auditing purposes. These recorded messages, known as log messages, provide valuable insights into the application's behavior, performance, and errors.

### Why Logging is Important

Logging is crucial for several reasons:

- **Debugging:** Identifying and fixing issues becomes much easier with detailed log messages.
- **Monitoring:** Tracking application performance, resource usage, and overall health.
- **Auditing:** Maintaining a record of user actions and system events for security and compliance purposes.
- **Troubleshooting:** Analyzing log data to pinpoint the root cause of problems.

### Understanding Logging Levels

Logging levels categorize log messages based on their importance. Common levels include:

- **DEBUG:** Detailed information for developers (e.g., method entry/exit, variable values).
- **INFO:** General information about the application's state (e.g., successful operations).
- **WARN:** Potential problems or unexpected conditions (e.g., resource limitations).
- **ERROR:** Critical errors that prevent normal operation (e.g., exceptions).
- **FATAL:** Severe errors that terminate the application (e.g., database connection failure).

By using different levels, you can control the amount of logging output based on the situation.
# User Registration and Details Viewing Project

## Project Overview

This project is a simple web application built using JSP (JavaServer Pages), Servlets, and PostgreSQL. It allows users to register and view their registration details. The application demonstrates the essential features of user authentication and data persistence while highlighting the importance of logging in web applications.

## Features

- **User Registration:** Users can register by providing their details, which are stored in a PostgreSQL database.
- **View Registration Details:** Registered users can log in to view their registration details.

## Technologies Used

- **JSP:** For creating dynamic web pages.
- **Servlets:** For handling requests and business logic.
- **PostgreSQL:** For data storage and retrieval.
  
## How to Run the Project

1. **Set up the Environment:**
   - Install Java Development Kit (JDK).
   - Install a web server such as Apache Tomcat.
   - Set up PostgreSQL and create a database for the project.

2. **Configure the Database:**
   - Create a table to store user registration details.
   - Update the database connection details in the project configuration.

3. **Deploy the Application:**
   - Compile the JSP and Servlet files.
   - Deploy the project on the web server.

4. **Access the Application:**
   - Open a web browser and navigate to the application URL.
   - Register a new user and log in to view the registration details.

## Project Structure

- **src/:** Contains the Java source files for the Servlets.
- **web/:** Contains the JSP files for the web pages.
- **WEB-INF/:** Contains the web.xml configuration file.
- **lib/:** Contains the necessary libraries for database connectivity.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a basic user registration and detail viewing application using JSP, Servlets, and PostgreSQL. By implementing logging, the application can provide valuable insights into its operation, making it easier to debug, monitor, and audit.
